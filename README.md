# Ml-Assignment-2

The project successfully implemented a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline that addressed key challenges in the dataset. By exploring, cleaning, analyzing, encoding, and 
scaling the data, the project enhanced the quality and reliability of the data, making it suitable for machine learning tasks. This preprocessing pipeline ensures that the data is well-prepared for building accurate and effective machine learning models

Data Exploration – Understanding the dataset by listing unique values and performing statistical analysis.
Data Cleaning – Handling missing, inappropriate, and duplicate values, as well as detecting outliers.
Data Analysis – Filtering specific data points and visualizing key relationships.
Data Encoding – Converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
Feature Scaling – Normalizing numerical values for better model performance.
